In computer programming jargon, a heisenbug is a software bug that seems to disappear or alter its behavior when one attempts to study it.
The term is a pun on the name of Werner Heisenberg, the physicist who first asserted the observer effect of quantum mechanics, 
which states that the act of observing a system inevitably alters its state. 

In electronics, the traditional term is probe effect, where attaching a test probe to a device changes its behavior.
